Description:
	Simulating a computer's cpu process. Simulating the cpu using four processes Round Robin(timesplice: 100), SJF(w/preemption),
	SJF(w/o preemption), and Preemptive Priority. With no user interaction this programs generates an 80% IO bound process and
	a 20% CPU processes. Then iterates through each algorithm demonstrating how each algorithm works.
